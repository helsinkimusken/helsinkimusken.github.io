round 1：

- To make sure we have proper protection for the info sharing
- Firebase Security improvements
  - consolidate the API keys, log in info safetly
  - step-by-step instruction for developer (me) to follow


* User login feature proposal
  * QR code embeded in APP GUI for wechat user to scan
  * Access only allowed for specified users
  * No additional check



Round 2:

Please take note this App is hosted on github.io. 


- ✅ GitHub account: `helsinkimusken`
- ✅ GitHub repository: `helsinkimusken.github.io`

I have to make my repository public, before I grant users to access.

Please review your current implementation of security for Firebase realtime database.

Can you resolve the potential security issue properly?


Round 3: 

The  function layout for project and info sharing should be optimized to up-down two sections, instead of left-right.

info sharing should be linked to projects, instead of mixed display.

dashboard should be sorted per project, focusing on project deliverales, bottleneck, achievements.

feedback: 

1. layout is good. up-down staked successfully
2. project indicator shown for info sharing panel
